# The Elections Project
The goal of this project is use elections data and other public data sets to generate useful insights. Since the elections are run by states in the US, one of the biggest challenges is to collect, clean and compile the data itself. The phase 1 of this project is to build a clean store of the elections results and to build out a process to do that for future elections.
